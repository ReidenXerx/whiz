// swift-testing lives in Testing.framework. A full Xcode install wires it into
// SwiftPM automatically; a Command Line Tools install ships the framework but
// not the search path, so `swift test` fails with "no such module 'Testing'".
// XCTest is not an escape hatch — it ships only with Xcode, so on a CLT machine
// there is no test framework at all without this.
//
// Detected rather than hardcoded, so the flag is absent on Xcode machines where
// it would be wrong.
// Paths in `unsafeFlags` are NOT resolved relative to the package root — they
// reach the compiler as written and are interpreted against its working
// directory, so "vendor/install/include" silently fails to find whisper.h.
// Deriving an absolute path from the manifest's own location works from any
// checkout and any invocation directory.

// `swift test` requires full Xcode. Nothing here works around that, deliberately.
//
// An earlier version added `-F` pointing at Command Line Tools' Testing.framework
// when it found one, so the test target would at least compile on a CLT-only
// machine. That was wrong twice over. It bought nothing — executing the resulting
// .xctest bundle needs the `xctest` runner, which ships only with Xcode, so the
// tests could compile and still never run. And on a machine with *both*
// installed it actively broke `swift test`, because the flag pointed at CLT's
// swift-testing runtime while the active toolchain was Xcode's.
//
// Detecting the active toolchain instead is not worth it: SwiftPM sandboxes
// manifest execution, so there is no dependable way to ask, and a correct answer
// would still only enable a build that cannot be run.

// The whiz macOS app.
//
// Deliberately dependency-free. The one thing an external package would buy
// us is TOML parsing, but whiz's config schema is a flat `key = value` file
// (see `whiz/config.py:_emit_toml`), so `FlatTOML.swift` handles it in ~120
// lines and the package builds offline.
//
// SwiftPM produces a bare executable; `scripts/build-app.sh` wraps it into a
// proper `Whiz.app` bundle with Info.plist. That is what gives us a stable
// bundle identifier, and therefore a TCC permission grant that survives
// upgrades.

    // targeting anything older would mean hand-rolling NSStatusItem and
    // LaunchAgent plists again — reintroducing the workarounds this port exists
